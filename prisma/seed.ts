    overview: `## Overview

The Aavenomics proposal is a plan to make the Aave Protocol more decentralized and independent. It has ideas for how to share the responsibility for the Protocol between different groups of people, and how to make sure that everyone is working together towards the same goals. The proposal also includes a way to keep everyone involved in the governance of the Protocol active and engaged.`,
    tokenOverview: `## Safety Model


The Aave Protocol is secured by a system called the Safety Module (SM). The SM is a smart contract that incentivizes people to lock their AAVE tokens in it. This is done by giving them a share of the fees generated by the protocol. If there is ever a deficit in the Aave ecosystem, the SM will be used to cover it. The SM includes a backstop mechanism to prevent too many AAVE tokens from being sold on the open market, which would reduce the value of AAVE.


## Governs
1. Insurance pool

2. Money markets

3. Ecosystem reserve

4. Risk Policies
- Assets compatible for integration within Aave
- Modelling of the interest rates
- Base risk parameters for overcollateralization and liquidation
- Configuration and behaviour of the Safety Module (SM)
- Acceptance of new liquidity markets

5. Improvement Policies
Improvement policies define rules under which ecosystem improvements are incepted, developed and applied to the ecosystem, including but not limited to: Smart Contracts; Governance processes; Governance contracts; Safety Module; AAVE Token contract

6. Incentives Policies
- Safety Incentives ensure the safety of the protocol by incentivizing AAVE holders to participate in the Safety Module.
- Ecosystem Incentives for Liquidity Providers and Liquidators`,

The Gelato DAO is powered by the Gelato token (GEL). The Gelato token is the central focal point of all relevant stakeholders in the network. The token exists as a utility for effective incentive alignment amongst the protocols' participants. Token holders will be able to signal their support for or opposition to Proposals in the Gelato DAO.

All token holders are able to have a say in the future direction of the protocol via voting on proposals in the Gelato DAO. The goal is that in the long run, developers that use Gelato to automate their smart contracts functions will govern over the protocol in order to determine the “rules” by which the Executor bots that serve the network have to adhere by.`,
    tokenOverview: `## Staking of GEL Token


To be an executor in the Gelato Network and earn rewards, you need to own some $GEL and stake it. Staking allows you to reserve slots, which give you the right to earn fees from executing transactions during a certain period of time.
Rewards come from two sources:
1) transaction fees charged on top of each transaction and
2) market opportunities that can be taken advantage of by back running transactions.

## Governs
1. Setting fees for Executors.

2. Developer incentive schemes.

3. Enforcing that Executors always execute transactions in the best interest of the end-user.`,

The SushiSwap community governs the project through forum discussion and voting on proposals. Only proposals that are posted on the SushiSwap Snapshot voting system by the CORE team can be considered binding if they pass with a quorum.

The community votes on major structural changes and use of the devfund wallet, while the core team decides on smaller changes affecting operations, such as changes to the SushiSwap menu or farming pairs. The mandate for this comes from the proposal linked in the text.

Any use of the devfund wallet requires approval from the Multisig team, which is made up of trusted members of the DeFi & Ethereum ecosystem. The Ops Multisig team must also approve any changes within their purview, such as rebalancing and administration of farming pools and use of the growth fund.

The goal is to establish a DAO with working, trustless governance. This is not an easy task, and all are welcome to discuss how the future DAO should work on the forums and in the #governance channel of the Discord server.`,

  title: 'Revised ARC: Add 1INCH as collateral',
  juniorDescription: "The proposal seeks to add 1inch Network's 1INCH token as a collateral option in the Aave protocol. The 1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network, and has a number of benefits that make it a good candidate for inclusion in Aave.",
  middleDescription: `1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program.

The 1INCH token is being proposed to be listed as a collateral asset on the Aave lending platform. The motivation for this is that 1INCH is a highly liquid asset with a wide range of holders, and listing it on Aave would provide holders with a way to tap into their equity without selling. Additionally, the 1INCH token is not currently listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave would have a first-mover advantage.`,
  seniorDescription: '# Summary\n1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M\n\nThe 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.\n\nOn April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.\n\nThere is an extensive list of audits available on Github.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nAudits: https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-audits\n1inch Genesis: 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f\nBurn 1INCH Key Transaction: 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nPlease see the discussion on the governance forum, linked below, for full context on the associated risks for listing 1INCH.  Due to the character limitation of snapshot, a summary of Gauntlet\'s risk parameters for listing the asset as collaerla on Aave v2 is shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Vaue|\n| --- | --- |\n|Collateral|Yes|\n|Borrowing|Yes|\n|LTV|40%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|50%|\n|Liquidation Penalty|8.5%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|UOptimal|45%|\n|R_0|0%|\n|R_s1|7%|\n|R_s2|300|',

  middleDescription: `agEUR is a € stablecoin with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. It can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theoretically infinite.
The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC.
agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg. Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.

I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode: V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling.`,
  seniorDescription: 'Enable agEUR as a collateral in isolation mode on AAVE V3 on Polygon.\n\n## Summary\n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.\nThe protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. \n\nagEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.\n\nAt the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.\n\nThere are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). \nBesides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.\n\nStablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).\nThe protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.\n\n## Links\n\n- Official: https://angle.money\n- Docs: https://docs.angle.money\n- Token Contracts: [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a7e4e63778b4f12a199c062f3efdd288afcbce8), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe0b52e49357fd4daf2c15e02058dce6bc0057db4).

This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.\n\nRight now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.\n\nRelative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.\n\nDoing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.\n\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.\n\nV3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon\n\n## Specifications \n\n**1.

RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.\n\n# Motivation\nThe Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens).\n\nThe Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset).\n\nWe would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocol’s design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave.\n\nWhen RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RToken’s full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now.\n\n# Specifications\n## Link between the author & the project: \nThe Reserve team\n## High level overview of the project: \nThe mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+(**) cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole)\nThe Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily (https://tinyurl.com/mudrhh4d).\n\nThe Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc).\n\nA key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken’s collateral.\n\n(**) We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s).\n\n## Why would RSR be a good borrow asset?\nWe anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield.\n\nThese are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don’t expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform.\n\nAave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand.\n\nBy listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties.\n\n## Brief history of the project’s components\nThe main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol.\n\nThe Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later.\n\nAn initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol/2021_version/).\n\n## How is the asset currently used?\nAt this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes:\n1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens.\n2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc).\n## Emission schedule\nThe total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors.\n\nThe [Slow Wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70?a=0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. It’s under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks.\n\nMore details here: [Release schedule](https://reserve.org/protocol/rsr_release_schedule/#main-content)\n\n## Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nThe total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply).\n\nThe contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770/home), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.\n\n## Market data:\n- Market cap: ~$135,661,594\n- 24h volume: ~$41,000,000 (6mo daily avg)\n- Exchanges: Binance, Huobi Global, Crypto.com, OKX, FTX, Kucoin, Bithumb, Gate, Uniswap, IDEX ([and many more](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/reserve-rights/markets/))\n- Social channels data:\n     - English Twitter: ~101K followers\n     - Spanish Twitter: ~68K followers\n     - Spanish TikTok: ~168K followers\n     - Spanish Instagram: ~67K followers\n## Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nImportant to note here is that Reserve only recently switched to a new RSR contract in order to prepare for the Reserve Protocol on Ethereum mainnet launch.

  juniorDescription: 'The Gelato team is proposing a plan to increase the liquidity of GEL tokens by issuing bonds through the Olympus Pro platform. The bonds will be purchased with G-UNI tokens, which can be acquired by providing liquidity to the GEL / ETH pool on Uniswap v3.',
  middleDescription: `The problem is that it's hard to buy and sell the Gelato token because there's not enough people trading it. This means that the price could be very volatile, and if you want to buy or sell you might have to pay a lot more or a lot less than you expect.

To fix this problem, the person writing this proposal suggests that the Gelato DAO (a group that controls the Gelato token) should use some of its money to create more liquidity. This would make it easier to buy and sell the token, and make the price more stable.

They suggest creating a pool of Gelato and Ethereum tokens that anyone can trade, and then using that pool to purchase bonds from Olympus Pro. This would create a stream of income for the DAO from the trading fees, which they could use to support the growth of the Gelato network.`,

This would mean that there would be three remaining working groups within the ENS DAO: the Meta-Governance Working Group, the ENS Ecosystem Working Group, and the Public Goods Working Group. The reasoning behind this proposal is that some of the subgroups within the Community Working Group could comfortably fall within the ENS Ecosystem Working Group, and that the DAO does not have enough active participants to justify having "community" as a standalone working group. If the proposal is passed, incoming Community Working Group Stewards will not be required to serve as Stewards of the Community Working Group in the Second Term, which starts on July 1, 2022.',
  seniorDescription: 'This vote proposes to dissolve the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022.\n\n## Description\n\nThis is a proposal to dissolve the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022 in accordance with rule 3.1 of the working group rules passed under [EP 4](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules). \n\nIf this proposal is passed, the Community Working Group will be dissolved at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022, leaving three remaining working groups within the ENS DAO:\n\n1. Meta-Governance Working Group;\n2. ENS Ecosystem Working Group; and\n3. Public Goods Working Group.\n\nOn the basis that new working groups cannot be formed within the DAO unless it can shown that “… the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group” (rule 2.2), the same standard should apply for the dissolution of working groups.\n\nAfter consulting with Stewards and Community Working Group participants, regarding their work and experiences during the First Term of 2022, it is clear that:\n\n1. each subgroup within the Community Working Group could comfortably fall within the Ecosystem Working Group; and \n2. the DAO does not have enough active participants to justify having \"community\" as a standalone working group. \n\nTherefore, using the same standard set out in rule 2.2, we should dissolve the Community Working Group and migrate all existing subgroups from that working group to the Ecosystem Working Group or another working group as appropriate. \n\nBy dissolving the Community Working Group, the remaining working groups will have distinct mandates that provide clarity for contributors, without overlap. This will allow stewards to more efficiently facilitate work within the remaining working groups.\n\n#### Please note\nThere is currently an election taking place on Snapshot to elect Community Working Group Stewards for the Second Term. \n\nThis proposal, to dissolve the Community Working Group, has been moved to a vote at this time at the request of current Meta-Governance Working Group Stewards to minimize disruption and ensure that results are available soon after steward elections conclude. \n\nIf this vote passes, incoming Community Working Group Stewards will not be required to serve as Stewards of the Community Working Group in the Second Term, which starts on July 1, 2022. If the vote does not pass, incoming community stewards will take up their positions within the Community Working Group on July 1, 2022. \n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a proposal to:\n\n1. Dissolve the Community Working Group;\n2. Return any unspent funds remaining in the Community Working Group multi-sig, at end of the First Term of 2022, to the ENS DAO treasury; and\n3. Migrate all existing subgroups within the Community Working Group to other working groups within the ENS DAO before the end of the First Term of 2022.\n\nThe ENS DAO will have three working groups for the Second Term of 2022 and all Terms thereafter. These working groups will be:\n\n- Meta-Governance Working Group: provides governance oversight and support of the management and operation of the ENS DAO;\n- ENS Ecosystem Working Group: continues development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem; and\n- Public Goods Working Group: funds public goods within web3 in accordance with the ENS DAO constitution.\n\n## Voting\n\nThis vote will be a single-choice vote. You may vote \"For\" or \"Against\" this proposal, or chose to abstain from the vote.\n\nBy voting \"For\" this proposal, you are voting in favor of dissolving the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022, in accordance with the specification set out in this proposal.',

  title: '[1IP-09] Collect 1inch DAO Treasury Revenue in 1INCH Token in Addition to USDC',
  juniorDescription: 'The 1inch Network DAO\'s Treasury is currently made up entirely of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin. This proposal seeks to diversify the Treasury by adding other assets, such as ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI, and USDT.',
  middleDescription: 'The proposal is about diversifying the 1inch Network DAO\'s Treasury, by enacting a strategy where some incoming Swap Surplus tokens are not exchanged for USDC, but instead are kept as collected (in their original form). The proposal aims to whitelist ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI, and USDT as the tokens that can be kept in this way. The motivation for this is that the 1inch DAO Treasury is currently 100% composed of USDC, which can be subject to inflationary pressures. By diversifying the treasury\'s holdings, it can hedge against some of these risks.',
  seniorDescription: '## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to modify the 1inch Network DAO Treasury’s revenue collection strategy by enacting the following changes:\n\n* Switch from buying USDC with Swap Surplus revenue to buying 1INCH when the price is lower than $1.30.\n* Switch from buying 1INCH with Swap Surplus revenue to buying USDC the price of 1INCH is greater than or equal to $1.70.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, the Swap Surplus [revenue stream](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/dao-treasury#revenue-stream) is collected in varying tokens and swapped to [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) before it is then sent to the 1inch DAO [Treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/transactions/history). Once enacted, this proposal will instead swap these tokens to [1INCH](https://etherscan.io/token/0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302) as long as the market price of 1INCH is below the $1.30 to $1.70 range (see the Specification section for a detailed explanation). All swaps will be done using the [1inch Aggregation Protocol](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/aggregation-protocol/introduction) to ensure the best pricing.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBenefits to the 1inch Network DAO include:\n\n* Investing the DAO’s revenue stream into the protocol’s governance token while the governance token is lower than it was previously valued.\n* Potential upward pressure on the 1INCH token as the DAO Treasury will be a net buyer of cheap 1INCH.\n* When the token is trading at higher valuations, the Treasury will automatically de-risk by collecting revenue in stable coins.\n* Holding 1INCH within the 1inch DAO Treasury will allow the Treasury to scale its value with the performance of the token.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify the fee collection strategy with the following changes:\n\n* When the price of 1INCH moves is below $1.30, Swap Surplus revenue shall start to be collected in 1INCH.\n* When the price of 1INCH moves above $1.70, Swap Surplus revenue shall be collected in USDC.\n\nOnce the modifications have been made and tested, 1inch Labs shall deploy them. All future modifications to these will need to be done by a 1inch DAO Governance vote.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal aims to purchase 1INCH with treasury revenue when the price is lower than ~$1.50. $0.20 bands are used on either side of this buying point in order to dampen the impact that market volatility could have.\n\nThis price point of 1INCH that triggers the switch can be changed in the future via a governance vote.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Market Risk\n\nThe USDC stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury puts the Treasury in a very good position during any bearish market cycles — the Treasury constantly grows in dollar value while, in contrast, projects that primarily hold their own token, have had the real value of their Treasury shrink in the last 6 months.\n\nAdding 1INCH to the Treasury composition will increase both the potential risk and potential returns. This proposal dampens the volatility by maintaining a mix of risk-on and risk-off assets.\n\n### Added Complexity\n\nIf enacted, this proposal will add complexity to the Treasury Revenue collection strategy.',

  middleDescription: 'The 1inch Network DAO is proposing to modify the way it collects revenue, by swapping tokens for 1INCH when the price is below $1.30, and swapping tokens for USDC when the price of 1INCH is above $1.70.

  seniorDescription: '## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to diversify the 1inch Network DAO’s Treasury composition be enacting the following strategy:\n\n* Do not exchange a whitelisted set of tokens for USDC before sending to the 1inch DAO Treasury.\n* These whitelisted tokens shall be: ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI, and USDT.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, all of the Swap Surplus revenue stream is collected in varying tokens and swapped to USDC before being sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury. To start the diversification process of the treasury funds, the protocol can keep some incoming Swap Surplus tokens as collected (not swapping them for USDC).\n\nThis proposal aims to whitelist the following tokens for this treasury collection strategy:\n\n* ETH\n* WETH\n* WBTC\n* DAI\n* USDT\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe 1inch DAO Treasury is 100% composed of USDC. USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD managed by Circle.\n\nUSD experienced record inflation over the last 12 months, and will experience some degree of inflation for perpetuity. As such, the marginal spending power of the 1inch DAO Treasury is weakened unless the DAO deploys the funds in a manner that can outpace inflation.\n\nThese assets are viewed as risk-on diversification assets for the treasury:\n\n* ETH – the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain\n* WETH – ETH wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper\n* WBTC – Bitcoin (BTC) is the oldest and largest digital asset. WBTC is Bitcoin wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper\n\nStablecoins also have inherent risks such as smart contract risks and centralization risks. Diversifying the stable coin holdings of the 1inch DAO Treasury aims to hedge against these risks. These assets are viewed as risk-off assets for the treasury:\n\n* DAI – the decentralized collateral-backed stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol. DAI is soft-pegged to USD\n* USDT – the fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD and managed by Tether\n\n## Specification\n\nTo implement this proposal, GovernanceLeftoverExchanger should transfer ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI and USDT directly to the treasury the same way it transfers USDC. All other tokens should still be converted to USDC as they are now.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe crypto market cap took a decline in recent months. With token valuations depressed, it may be a good time to start accumulating non-stable tokens to grow the treasury.\n\nSince exchange transactions cost some Ether to pay for the gas fees, eliminating the swapping step for these whitelisted tokens will increase the capital efficiency of this operation. It is also for this reason that large stable coins such as DAI and USDT, should be sent directly to the treasury.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe current stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury ensures that the Treasury is insulated from bearish market cycles. However, this also means the treasury’s funds have no way to keep pace with the rise in inflation. Adding ETH, WETH and WBTC increase both the risk and the potential rewards.\n\nThis proposal does not call for any actions to be taken with the funds currently held by the 1inch DAO Treasury.',

This means that 1inch will start using Balancer Boosted Pools to provide liquidity for its trades.

  seniorDescription: '## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal calls for the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/boosted-pools) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following\n\n1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.\n2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.\n3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBalancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the [1inch Governance Forum](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-balancer-boosted-pools/3012) as well as the [1inch Network DAO Community Call #02](https://youtu.be/OQF0wqgQXDg).\n\nGiven that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancer’s BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancer’s BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancer’s BatchSwap function.\n\nWe expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1:\n\n1. bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL\n2. bbfUSD, [expected](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023) to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI\n\nThis is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO.\n\nUpon satisfactory integration <sup>*Note1*</sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address:\n\n0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D.\n\n*Note 1*: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSupport for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancer’s Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well.\n\nBalancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched.\n\nThis BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net.\n\nBecause Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.',

  seniorDescription: '## Summary\n\n1inch Network was founded on core values of decentralization and open financial freedom, with a goal of improving the human condition for everyone on the planet. As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need.\n\nWith that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSince inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraine’s conflict zone.\n\nSpecifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined [here](https://twitter.com/ukraine/status/1497594592438497282?s=21). These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1inch Network is a global project which brings together extraordinary minds from all over the world. Both users and contributors alike are negatively affected by the recent war-time events unfolding this week, and it is the absolute duty of 1inch DAO to provide support to civilians within the conflict zone in every way possible.\n\n## Specification\n\n1.

Specifically, it calls for the following additions:\n\n* Aggregation protocol is expanded to include derivatives \n* Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and 1inch API \n* The first derivative supported will be Opium’s TURBO products (call options)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol – specifically, the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs, and will require the support of 1inch Foundation. \n\n## Motivation\n\n1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on: **the aggregation of derivative products.** \n\nBy implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token liquidity). \n\n## Specification \n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the 1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.\n\nOpium’s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:\n\n* Community / users can “write” covered calls by pooling their tokens in order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)\n* Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset\n\nAdding Opium’s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined. \n\nOpium’s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via documentation and SDKs.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on mainnet. \n\nSince all work described in this proposal will be organized by the 1inch Foundation, this will not cost any treasury funds.',

  title: 'Should Uniswap provide Rage Trade with an additional use grant?',
  juniorDescription: 'The proposal is for an additional use grant for the Rage Trade protocol. The protocol is built on top of Uniswap v3 and adds new features for traders, such as leverage trading and real-time funding rates. The grant would be used to cover the costs of developing the necessary libraries to enable these features.',
  middleDescription: 'Rage Trade is a new way to do swaps using Uniswap v3. We need an additional use grant because we have built libraries that enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries makes use of Uniswap\'s BUSL protect code. Approving this proposal will benefit Uniswap because it will add new liquidity and TVL, and we will spend resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategies.',
  seniorDescription: 'Authors: [Noodles](https://twitter.com/crypto_noodles) + [Crema](https://twitter.com/0xCrema) + [Vertex](https://twitter.com/0xVertex) \n\nRelated Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)\n\n### What is Rage Trade?\n\n[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3’s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.\n\n### Why do we need an additional use grant?\n\nOur proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3’s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap’s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. \n\n### What changes have we made that require additional use?\n\nWe have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap’s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):\n\n- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap’s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.\n- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap\'s TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.\n- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.\n- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.\n\n\n ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?\n\n1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.\n\n2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve’s tricrypto.\n\n3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nRage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap’s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.\n',

  seniorDescription: '**Summary**:\n\nEnable a 1bp, 1tick fee tier on optimism (L2).\n\nThe rationale and initial temperature check for this proposal can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930\n\n**Process**:\n\nThe complete process is described in Uniswap’s Governance Reference here 4 and can be summarized as:\n\n• A proposal is posted in GovernorBravo on Mainnet (GovernorAlpha for Kovan)\n\n• The proposal is voted, queued and executed via Timelock.\n\n• When all the conditions are meet and is executed, Timelock contract, which is authorized to execute administrative actions on the protected contracts, will execute \nthe requested actions in the proposal.\n\nSince this proposal needs to be executed on a different network, in this case L2 Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. In order to do that, Timelock will send the transaction to OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2).\n\nThe transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswap’s CrossChainAccount, that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to UniswapV3Factory.\nThe sequence of contract interactions is the following:\n\n• GovernorBravo.propose(targets, values, signatures, calldatas, description)\n    ◦ where targets are the address of the contracts to interact with,\n    ◦ calldatas the calldatas to execute on those contracts, and\n    ◦ description, the description of the proposal (or name)\n\n• OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(target, calldata, gas)\n    ◦ where target is the address of the contracts to interact with on L2,\n    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract, and\n    ◦ gas, the gas to be used on that transaction\n\n• CrossChainAccount.forward(target, calldata)\n    ◦ where target is the address of the Uniswap contracts to interact with on L2, and\n    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract\n\n• UniswapV3Factory.enableFeeAmount(fee,tickSpacing)\n    ◦ where fee is the fee to enable (in hundredths of a bip), and\n    ◦ tickSpacing the spacing between ticks\n\nCompiling all the calls together it can be seen as:\n\nGovernorBravo.propose(\n[OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger address],\n[ 0 ],\n[ “” ],\n[ encodedCalldata(\nOVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(\nCrossChainAccount address,\nencodedCalldata(CrossChainAccount.forward(\nUniswapV3Factory

  seniorDescription: 'Authors: [Trent](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) (PG Member), [Tim](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko) (PG Member)\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors.\n\nWe propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot.\n\nParticipating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.\n\n### Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/mEDvFXGCKdDhR-N320KRtsq60Y2OPk8rHcHBCFVryXY)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [PG twitter account](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild)\n\n### Context\n\n1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn’t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.\n2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.\n3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.\n\nHere’s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).\n\nIf we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - “Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games”; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))\n\n### What is the Protocol Guild?\n\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:\n\n* current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6-guidelines-for-regular-operation.html#weighting)\n* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure\n* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust\n\nTo date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.\n\nThe Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html) have more information.\n\n \n![0xsplits horizontal.png](ipfs://QmdpmizBcNGuVV5FZR4zLUz3wsYTTdfNpVZsywMC7Utpdo)\n    \n\n### PG Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016/1), and the [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b) ([forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/50)) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days.\n\nThe funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild’s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022](https://openorgs.info/)), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:\n\n* Uniswap’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth\n  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework.\n* Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap community’s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this Temp Check Snapshot vote has a positive outcome, we will move to a consensus check, and then an onchain vote.',

  seniorDescription: '## Context\n\nAfter passing the [Temperature Check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb328c7583c0f1ea85f8a273dd36977c95e47c3713744caf7143e68b65efcc8a5) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), we are creating this post to move forward into the Consensus Check stage.\n\nComments on [the previous post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-v3-be-deployed-to-gnosis-chain/16513) expressed support for v3 deployment on GC, but also suggested more clarity on the following topics:\n\n* The team that will be deploying Uniswap v3 on GC\n* The bridge used to facilitate cross-chain governance for Uniswap v3 on GC\n* The details of liquidity incentives provided, including timelines and logistics for transferring funds\n\nWe have updated this post accordingly and provided more details on each of these items.\n\n## About Gnosis Chain\n\nIn production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.\n\nTuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to “accelerate Ethereum,” Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:\n\n1. A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/\n](https://gnosischain.world/)\n2. An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.\n\n3. Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\nThe primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n4. Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.\n\n5. User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\n\nThe $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn’t have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.\n\n## Cross-Chain Governance with Nomad\n\nSince the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we’ve also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz) team’s proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.\n\nIn the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we’ve partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:\n\n* [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains\n* Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs\n\nNomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.\n\nWe are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\n## License Exemption\n\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Proposal Acceptance and Execution\n\nAs the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\n\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.',

We now move to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nMoonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n\nMoonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap’s trusted brand.\n\n## About Moonbeam\n\nMoonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot’s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.\n\nMoonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.\n\n## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam\n\nWe believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. \n\nUniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nUnlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market — Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values — decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way.\n\nMoonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.\n\nThe Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext](https://medium.com/connext/connext-has-partnered-with-nomad-e20cd8e62e31) have already been deployed as Moonbeam’s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.\n\n## Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance\n\nDecentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) and [Connext](https://www.connext.network/) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance.\n\nWe have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQWXCXdA5to7RKfVPozI8vEcw_QJrRQMP9HiQ8nbOu0/edit#heading=h.708hyjg41wlu) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains.\n\nNomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad’s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts-core/contracts/governance/GovernanceRouter.sol) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/pull/95) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.\n\n\n## Rewards and Grants\n\nAs part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nThrough collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal.\n\nTo borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/#:~:text=Uniswap%20Grants%20gained%20access%20to,Gitcoin%20was%20founded%20in%202017) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund “bounties, hackathons, and grants” for “developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders” working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner.\n\n\nExamples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: \n- Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam\n- Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users\n- Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap\n- Leveraging Substrate’s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain\nFunding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences\n\nWe are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:\n\n- **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam’s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam’s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. \n- **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap’s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad’s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.\n- **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap’s multi-chain presence.\n\nWe are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!',
